The Clean Architecture is a software design pattern developed by renowned software engineer Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob." This approach is based on the principle of separation of concerns and aims to create highly maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems.

The Clean Architecture establishes a set of layers or levels that represent different responsibilities and functions within an application. These layers are organized in the form of concentric circles, where the inner layers depend on the outer layers, but not the other way around. The main components of Clean Architecture are as follows:

1. **Entities Layer**: This is the core of the application and contains the domain entities that represent key concepts and business rules. These entities are independent of any specific framework or technology.

2. **Use Cases Layer**: Also known as the Application or Business Layer, it handles the application logic and coordinates the interactions between the domain entities. Use cases and specific business rules of the application are defined here.

3. **User Interfaces Layer**: This layer is responsible for user interaction. It can include graphical interfaces, web services, APIs, etc. This layer does not contain business logic; it only receives and presents information to the user.

4. **Adapters Layer**: This layer acts as a bridge between the internal and external layers. It converts data from external interfaces into a format understandable to the internal layers and vice versa. Controllers, gateways, repositories, and other components that interact with databases, external services, frameworks, etc., reside in this layer.

The goal of this architecture is to maintain the independence of each layer and minimize external dependencies. This allows changes in one layer to be isolated and not affect others, facilitating software evolution and testing. Additionally, it promotes component reuse and facilitates the replacement of technologies since implementation details are encapsulated in the external layers.

In summary, Clean Architecture is a software design approach that promotes modularity, technology independence, and ease of maintenance. By separating concerns and establishing a clear structure, it enables the development of more robust and flexible applications over time.
